# vCard - [Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cstrachan.vcard)

This extension currently provides syntax highlighting for vCard files (.vcf, vcard). vCard files are used to exchange contact information as electronic business cards. More information about this file format can be found on [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard).

Future changes to this extension will include auto-complete, error checking (squiggles), quick view (on hover), and a preview window to make viewing and editing vCard files easier.
